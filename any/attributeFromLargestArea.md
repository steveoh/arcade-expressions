# Attribute from Intersection

This expression returns an attribute value from a featureSet where the largest feature intersects the input feature.

## Use cases

To suggest a value from a majority intersection. For instance, when drawing a polygon, return the county name for which the majority of the new polygon is in.

## Workflow

Copy and paste the expression found in the expression template below to the Arcade editor in ArcGIS Online, the relevant location in ArcGIS Pro, or the relevant location in a custom app.

To configure the script to your layer, edit the first line to specify the layer you would like to use instead of the example layer. 

```js
var set = FeatureSetByName($datastore,"Building Footprints")
```

Also edit the last line to specify the attribute you would like to use intead of the example `objectid`.

```js
getAttributeFromLargestArea($feature, set, 'objectid')
```

## Expression Template

This Arcade expression will extract the attribute value from a feature in a featureSet where the input feature intersection area is the largest.

```js
// Refer to the name of the layer used to search areas here.
var layerName = 'Building Footprints';
// your field name should go here
var fieldName = "objectid";

var set = FeatureSetByName($datastore, layerName)

function getAttributeFromLargestArea(feat, set, field) {
    var items = intersects(set, feat);
    var counts = count(items)
    
    if (counts == 0) {
        return { 'errorMessage': 'No intersection found' };
    }
    
    if (counts == 1) {
        var result = first(items);

        return result[field];
    }

    var largest = -1;
    var result;

    for (var item in items) {
        var size = area(intersection(item, feat));

        if (size > largest) {
            largest = size;
            result = item[field];
        }
    }

    return result;
}

getAttributeFromLargestArea($feature, set, fieldName) 
```
